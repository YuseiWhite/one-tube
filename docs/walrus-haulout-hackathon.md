## Tracks

Choose from dedicated tracks focused on key areas of the Sui ecosystem:

<aside>

**Data Economy/Marketplaces**

Build decentralized markets for data. Focus on provable ownership, pricing, and exchange of datasets, with clear incentives for producers and consumers.

Show us your 10x better approach to curation, quality incentives, and why users would choose decentralized over centralized platforms. Build a data market that preserves difficult-to-obtain data and protects free speech.

**AI x Data**

Leverage AI with onchain data. Explore how real-time data and models can drive smarter dApps, adaptive systems, and new gameplay/financial loops.

Show us how to democratize AI training using everyone's computers instead of centralized data centers. Build truly decentralized AI that trains across distributed compute and stores intermediaries on-chain

**Provably Authentic (Truth Engine + Trust Oracle)**

Authenticity onchain: verify provenance of media, create prediction markets for truth, or design AI trust oracles to prove source, training data, or reliability.

Build systems that turn data into value, from decentralized storage and exchange to models that forecast real-world outcomes. Explore how prediction markets can incentivize accurate data reporting, create collective intelligence, or tie oracle reliability to market performance.

**Data Security & Privacy**

Protect users and data. Explore fraud detection, consumer protection, zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable storage, and compliance-aligned privacy solutions.
